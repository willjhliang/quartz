Procrustes, also called the 3D-3D correspondence problem, finds the camera pose $R$ and $T$ from $N$ 3D-3D point correspondences $(A, B)$.

First, note that we only need $3$ points to find the transformation. We'll solve the $N=3$ problem first, then generalize to any $N$.

# 3 Points
We have $3$ correspondences, $(A_1, B_1), (A_2, B_2), (A_3, B_3)$. Let $A_{ij}$ denote the vector between $A_i$ and $A_j$, and same for $B_{ij}$. We first form an orthogonal basis $(a_1, a_2, a_3) = (A_{21}, A_{21} \times A_{31}, (A_{21} \times A_{31}) \times A_{21})$ and same for $(b_1, b_2, b_3)$.

Then, observe that an orthonormal basis is only affected by rotation. Thus, 
$$
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{a_1}{\Vert a_1 \Vert} & \frac{a_2}{\Vert a_2 \Vert} & \frac{a_3}{\Vert a_3 \Vert} \end{pmatrix} = R\begin{pmatrix} \frac{b_1}{\Vert b_1 \Vert} & \frac{b_2}{\Vert b_2 \Vert} & \frac{b_3}{\Vert b_3 \Vert} \end{pmatrix}
$$

Solve for $R = B^\top A$, then find $T$ accordingly.

# General Solution
For $N$ points, we'll find 
$$
\arg\min_{R, T} \sum_{i = 1}^N \Vert A_i - RB_i - T \Vert^2
$$


Differentiating the objective with respect to $T$, we find that $T$ is the difference between centroids after rotating $B$, 
$$
T = \bar{A} - R\bar{B}
$$
 where centroids $\bar{A} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^N A_i$ and $\bar{B} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^N B_i$.

Then, subtract the centroids from each point to get 
$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}A_1 - \bar{A} & \ldots A_N - \bar{A}\end{pmatrix}, \ B = \begin{pmatrix}B_1 - \bar{B} & \ldots B_N - \bar{B}\end{pmatrix},
$$
 and now our objective is 
$$
\arg\min_R \Vert A-RB\Vert_F^2
$$

This can be done with [[ðŸ“Ž Singular Value Decomposition]], setting $BA^\top = USV^\top$, then let 
$$
R = V \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \det VU^\top \end{pmatrix}U^\top
$$
