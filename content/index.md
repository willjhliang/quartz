*This is a collection of notes about machine learning, computer vision, and random other interesting topics.*

I'm <a href="https://willjhliang.github.io" target="_blank">Will Liang</a>, a student at the University of Pennsylvania. This website organizes my notes into neat, fun-sized pages. A few of them are work-in-progress, but I hope the rest are helpful for you!
