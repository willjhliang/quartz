Mean field approximation is a type of variational inference that assumes the variational distribution $q$ to take on a specific form, $$q(z) = \prod_{i=1}^m q(z_i)$$ where there are no dependencies across hidden variables.

When we apply the [[ðŸ§¬ Evidence Lower Bound]], we find that the optimal value for $q$, denoted as $q^*$, follows $$q^*(z_j) \propto \mathbb{E}_{q_{-j}} [\log p(x, z)]$$ where $q_{-j}$ in the expectation denotes a marginalization over all $z_i$ for $i \neq j$. We can thus optimize the ELBO via coordinate ascent, changing one dimension while keeping the others constant.
