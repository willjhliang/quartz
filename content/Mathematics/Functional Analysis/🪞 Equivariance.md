Equivariance is a form of symmetry for functions. Specifically, if function $f$ is equivariant to the symmetric operator $\sigma$, then 
$$
f(\sigma(x)) = \sigma(f(x)).
$$
 Note that generally, the operators don't have to be the same. The more broad definition for equivariance is 
$$
f(\sigma(x)) = \sigma'(f(x)).
$$
