Floating point numbers represent values in scientific notation; it's commonly used for real numbers (decimals) and really big numbers.

Scientific notation has the form 
$$
S * F * 2^E
$$
 where $S$ is the sign, $F$ is the significand (fraction), and $E$ is the exponent. Since we have a limited number of bits, the values won't be exact; small numbers can be very precise, while big numbers lose precision.
