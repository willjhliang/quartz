For a univariate function $y = f(x)$, the difference quotient 
$$
\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{f(x + \delta x) - f(x)}{\delta x}
$$
 approximates the slope at $x$. As $\delta x \rightarrow 0$, we get the derivative, 
$$
\frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{f(h)}
$$
 that points in the direction of steepest ascent.

# Differentiation Rules
The following are the four core differentiation rules.
1. Product rule: $(f(x)g(x))' = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$.
2. Quotient rule: $(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)})' = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g^2(x)}$.
3. Sum rule: $(f(x) + g(x))' = f'(x) + g'(x)$.
4. Chain rule: $(g(f(x))' = g'(f(x))f'(x)$.
