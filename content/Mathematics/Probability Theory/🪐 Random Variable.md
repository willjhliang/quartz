A random variable $X$ is a function that maps probabilistic outcomes $\omega$ to quantities of interest $x$. In layman's terms, $X$ is a variable that can take on different states at random.

Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the target space containing all such $x$. A random variable can be expressed as $X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathcal{T}$ where $\Omega$ is the outcome space, defined in context of a [[ðŸŽ² Probability Distribution]].

# Transformations
Sometimes, we're given random variable $X$ and a transformation $Y = U(X)$. Given the distribution for $X$, our task is to find the distribution for $Y$. The two core methods are detailed below.

## Distribution Function
This technique first finds the cdf of $Y$, then differentiates it to get the pdf.
1. Find $F_Y(y) = P(Y \leq y)$ by substituting $U(X)$ into $Y$.
2. Differentiate $f(y) = \frac{d}{dy}F_Y(y)$ to get the pdf.

## Change of Variables
The change of variables technique uses similar steps from the distribution function to generalize one final formula, $$f(y) = f_x(U^{-1}(y)) \cdot \left\vert \frac{d}{dy} U^{-1}(y)\right\vert.$$
