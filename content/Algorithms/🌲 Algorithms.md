Algorithms (and data structures) studies how we can efficiently solve common computational problems. Many of these problems can be done in brute force, but there are clever insights that allow for a smaller big-O complexity.

# Algorithms
1. [[🔎 Binary Search]] finds the insertion point for an element in a sorted sequence.
2. [[🚋 Breadth First Search]] and [[🚃 Depth First Search]] traverse graphs.
3. [[🚄 Dijkstra]] and [[🛩️ Bellman-Ford]] finds single-source shortest paths.
4. [[🚓 Floyd-Warshall]] finds all-pairs shortest paths.
5. [[🚈 Prim]] and [[🚟 Kruskal]] finds minimum spanning trees.
6. [[⛰️ Kahn]] and [[⏱️ Finish-Time DFS]] calculates topological sorts.
7. [[🏢 Kosaraju]] finds strongly connected components.
8. [[💧 Edmonds-Karp]] solves max-flow-min-cut.

# Data Structures
1. [[🌳 Binary Search Tree]] supports quick search and insert for sorted data.
2. [[🗻 Heap]] maintains min/max pops of a sequence.
3. [[🗼 Union-Find]] tracks disjoint sets.
4. [[📍 Hash Maps]] maps keys to values.
