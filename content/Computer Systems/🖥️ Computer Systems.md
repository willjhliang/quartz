Computer systems studies the design and operation of computers, from the scale of processor components to networking and distributed systems. Common topics include the following:
1. [[⚙️ Operating System]]: the underlying software running on a machine, bridging custom software and hardware.
2. [[🏓 Concurrency]]: how several threads of execution can occur at the same time, enabling more efficient computation.
3. [[🏛️ Computer Architecture]]: how processors are designed and connected with low-level software.
4. [[🗼 Networking]]: methods of communication between individual machines.
