The trace of a square [[üç± Matrix]] $A$ is defined as the sum of its diagonal elements. It satisfies the following properties.
1. $\text{tr}(A + B) = \text{tr}(A) + \text{tr}(B)$.
2. $\text{tr}(\alpha A) = \alpha \text{tr}(A)$.
3. $\text{tr}(AB) = \text{tr}(BA)$.

If $A$ and $B$ are similar (there exists $S$ such that $B = S^{-1}AS$), $\text{tr}(A) = \text{tr}(B)$.
