# Traversal Problem
Visit each vertex connected to source $s$ in a graph $G$, finding the shortest path from $s$ to $v$ for all $v$ in unweighted graph $G$.

# Theory
Keep a queue of vertices that can be visited, and for each vertex in the queue, add its neighbors to the queue if they havenâ€™t been visited before. The queue ensures that we go through vertices in ascending distance order, so BFS finds the minimum distance to all vertices (given that the graph is unweighted).

# Implementation
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(s, adj):
	q = deque([s])
	dist = {s: 0}
	while len(q) > 0:
		c = q.popleft()
		for n in adj[c]:
			if n not in dist:
				dist[n] = dist[c] + 1
				q.append(n)
```

# Runtime
$$ O(V+E) $$

We visit each vertex exactly once (due to the visited array) and each edge exactly once (since we visit an endpoint vertex exactly once), giving us a runtime of $O(V+E)$.
