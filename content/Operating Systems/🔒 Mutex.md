Mutex (mutual exclusion), or lock, is a method for ensuring [[ðŸš¥ Synchronization]] between [[ðŸ§¶ Thread]]s that share resources in critical sections. The general structure is as follows:
```
lock.acquire();
// critical section
lock.release();
```

When `acquire()` is called, a thread will own the lock if it's unused or block if the lock is used. Only one thread can acquire a lock at a time, and others will wait until it's finished. Thus, the critical section will be run from start to end by only one thread at any given time.

# Implementation
To ensure that lock operations are atomic and can't be interrupted, we implemented them with the TSL (test and set lock) instruction `TSL R, M`. This instruction is atomic at the hardware level and performs the following:
1. `R` is a register, `M` is a memory location.
2. `R` gets the value of `M`.
3. `M` is set to `1` after setting `R`.

The `acquire()` function essentially uses `TSL` to read a lock value `M`; if it's already `1`, then the lock is held by something else, and we block. In `release()`, we set the lock back to `0` and send a wakeup signal to processes that are blocked by the lock.

Lastly, to enforce the order of operation execution (since they can be mixed up if they're semantically equivalent), we use memory barriers to indicate to the CPU and compiler that all memory accesses before the barrier must occur before those that are after the barrier.
