Hidden Markov models are a common structure for [[‚è∞ Dynamic Bayesian Network]]s that model probability distribution with the Markov property, which states that each variable conditionally depends only on the variable right before it in the sequence.
$$p(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = p(x_1)p(x_2 \vert x_1)p(x_3 \vert x_2)p(x_4 \vert x_3).$$

We exploit this assumption to translate an input sequence to another sequence using a Markov matrix or graph that models probabilistic transitions across variables. The graph consists of hidden states and observable variables in the structure below; note that this structure is similar to [[‚õìÔ∏è Markov Chain]] with observable variables tacked onto the original states.

Each hidden state gives emissions with certain probabilities and transition to another hidden state with another set of probabilities. The input sequence we get is the observable variables $Y$, and for translation, our goal is to find the most probable sequence $X$ that generated these emissions.

To predict the probability of sequence $X$ given another sequence $Y$, we use [[ü™ô Bayes' Theorem]], ignoring the denominator and taking the highest probability.

$$\arg\max_X P(X \vert Y) = \arg\max_X \frac{P(Y \vert X)P(X)}{P(Y)} = \arg\max_X \prod_{i=1}^m P(y_i \vert x_i) P(x_i \vert x_{i-1})$$

For example, for speech recognition (predicting words from sounds), we start with a prior of the likelihood of each word along with likelihood of each sound given a word.

# Forward-Backward Algorithm
The forward-backward algorithm is an inference method for HMMs that estimates the hidden states given observations. Assuming $p(y_k \vert x_k), p(x_{k+1} \vert x_k), p(x_1)$ is known, our goal is to compute $p(x_k \vert y_{1:n})$.

To do this, we have the forward and backward steps, both computed using recursive message passing, similar to [[üïç Belief Propagation]].
1. Forward step computes $p(x_k, y_{1:k})$.
2. Backward step computes $p(y_{k+1:n} \vert x_k)$.

The forward and backward steps are detailed in the below sections. Assuming their values are known, we can then recover our target via marginalization over $$p(x_k \vert y) \propto p(x_k, y) = p(y_{k+1:n} \vert x_k, y_{1:k})p(x_k, y_{1:k}) = p(y_{k+1:n} \vert x_k) p(x_k, y_{1:k})$$ due to the conditional independence structure of the HMM. Note that the first term in the product uses our backward pass, and the second term uses the forward pass.

## Forward Pass
For the forward pass, we want to compute $p(x_k, y_{1:k}$). The key observation is that we can marginalize over $x_{k-1}$, then write a recursive definition: $$p(x_k, y_{1:k}) = \sum_{x_{k-1}} p(x_k, x_{k-1}, y_{1:k}) = \sum_{x_{k-1}} p(y_k \vert x_k) p(x_k \vert x_{k-1}) p(x_{k-1}, y_{1:k-1}).$$ Observe that the final term in our expression is exactly the distribution for $k - 1$. Thus, if we let our message $$\alpha_k(x_k) = p(x_k, y_{1:k}),$$ then we have $$\alpha_k(x_k) = \sum_{x_{k-1}} p(y_k \vert x_k) p(x_k \vert x_{k-1}) \alpha_{k-1}(x_{k-1}).$$ Our base message is $\alpha_1(x_1) = p(x_1)p(y_1 \vert x_1)$, and we can pass this all the way to $k$ to get back our desired probability.

## Backward Pass
The backward pass is similar to the forward pass: our goal is to compute $p(y_{k+1:n} \vert x_k)$, and we'll do so recursively with $$p(y_{k+1:n} \vert x_k) = \sum_{x_{k+1}} p(y_{k+1} \vert x_{k+1}) p(x_{k+1} \vert x_k) p(y_{k+2:n} \vert x_{k+1}).$$ Defining our message as $$\beta_k(x_k) = p(y_{k+1:n} \vert z_k),$$ we have $$\beta_k(x_k) = \sum_{x_{k+1}} p(y_{k+1} \vert x_{k+1}) p(x_{k+1} \vert x_k) \beta_{k+1}(x_{k+1})$$ with the base case $\beta_n(x_n) = 1$ (which we can derive from looking at the equation for $\beta_{n-1}(x_{n-1})$).
