The length of a vector $x$ is commonly calculated as $\Vert x \Vert$, a [[ðŸ“Œ Norm]]. This norm can be defined by [[ðŸŽ³ Inner Product]] 
$$
\Vert x \Vert = \sqrt{\langle x, x \rangle}.
$$
 However, note that not every norm can be induced by an inner product.

Distance is the length of a vector between two points. Thus, it's measured as 
$$
d(x, y) = \Vert x - y \Vert = \sqrt{\langle x - y, x - y \rangle}.
$$


# Cauchy-Schwarz
With $\Vert x \Vert$, we have the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality stating 
$$
\vert \langle x, y \rangle \vert \leq \Vert x \Vert \Vert y \Vert.
$$
